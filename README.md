Motivation

New York City’s 311 service request system received over 42 million inquiries in 2018 (NYC Open Data, 2019), covering noise, sanitation, infrastructure, and more. However, due to the sheer volume of requests, identifying and handling recurring issues and emerging concerns remains a challenge for city agencies. Our project leverages unsupervised machine learning techniques—such as clustering and topic modeling—to extract meaningful insights that help stakeholders like city officials proactively address problems of the local people and improve urban management.

Business Relevance

Our findings will have wide-reaching implications:
City Governance: Optimized resource allocation, improved response times, and data-driven policy decisions
Urban Development: Identifies high-complaint zones, influencing real estate trends and infrastructure planning
Private Sector & Utilities: Businesses can assess location-based risks, plan operations, and improve customer service strategies
With predictive analytics reducing inefficiencies by 15-20% (Harvard Data-Smart City Solutions, 2022), our project will enhance public services and urban resilience.
